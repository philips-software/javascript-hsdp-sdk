# HSDP SDK for JavaScript

This project provides a Software Development Kit that makes interaction with HSDP APIs easy for a JavaScript programmer. Instead of having to worry about composing the correct HTTP requests (required url, headers, body, query parameters, parsing responses), the user interacts with statically typed data structures, giving autocompletion and field name discovery of the request and response data structures.

- **Technology stack**: the library is intended for use in any JavaScript project that needs to interact with HSDP APIs.
- **Status**: the software is still in early development, only supporting a few of the HSDP APIs.

## Dependencies

The SDK can be used in any JavaScript project via any package manager.

## Installation

yarn add hsdp-sdk
```
